In this challenge we given the input `%u52%u55%u53%u48%u7B%u57%u48%u41%u54%u49%u53%u43%u4F%u44%u45%u42%u41%u42%u59%u44%u4F%u4E%u54%u48%u55%u52%u54%u4D%u45%u44%u4F%u4E%u54%u48%u55%u52%u54%u4D%u45%u4E%u4F%u4D%u4F%u52%u45%u7D%u0A%u0A`.

And then, we can see its ascii number. For read it we can replace the `%u` to space and decode it from the python script. And the we can know the flag is `RUSH{WHATISCODEBABYDONTHURTMEDONTHURTMENOMORE}`
