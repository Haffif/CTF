For find the flag we can open the google slides and then we can check it one by one.

There are three parts in slides contains flag:
1. First part, there is in slide page 3. we can see `RUSH{` on the bottom left corner.
2. The second part, there is in slide page 11. we can see on top `D1G1T4L_0CE4N`.
3. The final part, there is in slide page 15. we can see on the bottom right corner and the final part is `_1S_CO0L}`.

The flag is `RUSH{D1G1T4L_0CE4N_1S_CO0L}`
